# Answers to Bonus Questions

# Explain where you whent above and beyond the scope, and deserve a bonus.

# If applicable: 1-2 sentence on which frameworks/libraries you decided to use and why (e.g. I used Bootstrap over Foundation because...React vs Angular)

# If your code didn't pass the validators, explain why and what can you do (e.g. I implemented jQuery properly, but it has known bugs listed on this link).

# HTML, css, and any other files so that we can dump in a directory and run. If we need to compile something, step-by-step instructions on how.
